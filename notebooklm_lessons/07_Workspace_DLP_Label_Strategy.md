## Audio Overview Prompts

### Overview 1: Workspace DLP and Classification Fundamentals

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who has Google Workspace and needs to understand data loss prevention capabilities and classification label options - what's possible, what's built-in, and what requires add-ons.

**Cover:** Google Workspace DLP capabilities overview - Drive, Gmail, Chat; What DLP can detect - credit cards, SSNs, custom patterns, content classifiers; Built-in content classifiers vs. custom detectors; Classification labels in Workspace - what they are, how they differ from SaaS labels elsewhere; Three labeling methods - default classification, DLP rules, AI classification; Label components - label fields, label values, permissions tied to labels; DLP rule actions - warn, block, audit, apply labels; Gmail vs. Drive DLP differences; Real-time vs. retrospective DLP scanning; Licensing considerations - what's included in each Workspace edition.

**Exclude:** Classification strategy design (Overview 2), DLP rule implementation (Overview 3), User adoption strategies (Overview 4), Governance and iteration (Overview 5).

**Approach:** Give them the lay of the land. Many IT leaders don't know what Workspace DLP can actually do. Be clear about capabilities and limitations.

### Overview 2: Designing a Classification Strategy Users Will Accept

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who understands Workspace DLP capabilities (from Overview 1) and needs to design a classification scheme that balances security with usability - one users will actually adopt.

**Cover:** Common classification schemes - Public/Internal/Confidential/Restricted; Why many classification programs fail - too complex, too manual, unclear value to users; User-centric classification design - making labels meaningful to users' work; Starting simple - 2-3 levels initially, expand if needed; Label naming - avoid jargon, use business language; When to require manual classification vs. automatic; High-risk data types that demand classification - financial data, PII, customer data, M&A materials; Department-specific classifications vs. universal taxonomy; Visual indicators - label colors, Drive file badges, Gmail banners; User training needs for effective classification; Pilot testing classification schemes before organization-wide rollout; Learning from other organizations' classification strategies.

**Exclude:** Technical DLP capabilities (Overview 1), DLP rule configuration (Overview 3), Change management tactics (Overview 4), Long-term maintenance (Overview 5).

**Approach:** This is about design thinking and change management. Help them create a classification system that users see as helpful, not burdensome. Emphasize simplicity and clear value proposition.

### Overview 3: Implementing DLP Rules and Automated Labeling

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who has designed their classification strategy (from Overviews 1-2) and needs to configure DLP rules and automated labeling in Workspace.

**Cover:** DLP rule anatomy - conditions, actions, severity; Creating custom content detectors - regex patterns, keyword lists, document properties; Combining detectors with AND/OR logic; DLP rule actions in Drive - block sharing, restrict access, apply labels, notify; DLP rule actions in Gmail - block sending, warn user, quarantine, apply labels; Automatic label application via DLP - when file content matches patterns; AI-powered label suggestions - how Google's ML suggests labels; Label approval workflows - requiring human review of AI suggestions; Testing DLP rules - using audit mode before enforcement; Scoping rules - organizational units, groups, specific users; Rule priority and evaluation order; Performance considerations - avoiding overly broad rules; DLP rule limitations and edge cases.

**Exclude:** Strategy design (Overview 2), User adoption (Overview 4), Ongoing governance (Overview 5).

**Approach:** Make this a practical configuration guide. Walk through rule creation step-by-step. Address common pitfalls like overly aggressive rules that block legitimate work.

### Overview 4: User Adoption and Change Management

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who has implemented DLP and labels technically (from Overviews 1-3) and needs to drive user adoption - getting users to classify data correctly and work within DLP boundaries without resentment.

**Cover:** Why DLP adoption fails - lack of context, unclear workflows, seen as security theater; Communicating the "why" - data protection, compliance, customer trust; Training approaches - role-specific training, scenario-based learning, quick reference guides; Label application workflows - when to apply labels, how to choose the right one; User experience optimization - minimizing friction, making the right thing the easy thing; Handling DLP warnings and blocks - user communication, clear next steps; Support readiness - help desk training on DLP and label questions; Feedback loops - gathering user frustration points, iterating on rules; Executive sponsorship - leadership modeling classification behavior; Gamification and incentives - recognition for good data hygiene; Pilot groups and champions - early adopters who evangelize; Measuring adoption - classification rates, DLP block/warn rates, user sentiment.

**Exclude:** Technical capabilities (Overview 1), Strategy design (Overview 2), Rule configuration (Overview 3), Long-term governance (Overview 5).

**Approach:** This is pure change management. Help them understand that technology is 20% of the solution; user adoption is 80%. Provide practical tactics for driving behavior change.

### Overview 5: Governance, Monitoring, and Continuous Improvement

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who has DLP and labels running with user adoption (from Overviews 1-4) and needs to sustain and improve the program over time.

**Cover:** DLP monitoring dashboards - rule matches, user overrides, blocked actions, trends; Classification coverage metrics - percentage of files labeled, unlabeled sensitive data; Label accuracy audits - are labels correct, are users mis-classifying; Rule effectiveness analysis - false positives, false negatives, user bypass patterns; Incident response for DLP events - investigation workflows, escalation criteria; Compliance reporting - demonstrating DLP effectiveness for audits; Policy tuning - adjusting rules based on operational experience; Expanding DLP coverage - new data types, new applications, tighter controls; Label taxonomy evolution - adding/deprecating labels, migrating labels; User re-training - refreshers, new employee onboarding on DLP; Third-party DLP integrations - CASB, SIEM, DLP platforms; Balancing security with productivity - avoiding DLP fatigue; Success metrics that matter - risk reduction, compliance posture, user acceptance.

**Exclude:** Initial capabilities (Overview 1), Strategy design (Overview 2), Initial implementation (Overview 3), Launch and adoption (Overview 4).

**Approach:** Focus on sustainability and maturity. Help them build a program that improves over time rather than decaying. Emphasize metrics that demonstrate business value.

## Usage Instructions

1. Create a new notebook in Google NotebookLM
2. Copy all URLs from the Sources section and paste into NotebookLM
