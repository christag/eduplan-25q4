## Audio Overview Prompts

### Overview 1: Documentation as Product Philosophy
**Cover:** Why docs fail - treated as afterthought, outdated immediately, no ownership; Documentation as product mindset - users, value proposition, maintenance; Four types of documentation - tutorials, how-tos, reference, explanation (Diátaxis); Documentation debt and technical debt relationship; User-centered doc writing - who reads this, what do they need; "Docs or it didn't happen" culture; ROI of good documentation - reduced support burden, faster onboarding, knowledge retention; Common documentation anti-patterns; The problem with wiki sprawl. **Exclude:** Decision logs (Overview 2), Runbooks (Overview 3), Implementation (Overview 4), Governance (Overview 5).

### Overview 2: Architecture Decision Records and Decision Logs
**Cover:** What are ADRs - documenting significant architecture decisions with context and consequences; ADR template structure - title, status, context, decision, consequences; Why document decisions - preventing "why did we do this?" conversations years later; Decision log vs. meeting notes - structured vs. unstructured; Lightweight ADRs vs. heavyweight design docs; Where to store ADRs - in code repo, wiki, documentation platform; Linking decisions to code changes; Reviewing and updating ADRs over time; Decision reversal - superseding old decisions. **Exclude:** Runbooks (Overview 3), Doc systems (Overviews 1, 4), Governance (Overview 5).

### Overview 3: Operational Runbooks That Work
**Cover:** What makes runbooks different - operational procedures for known scenarios; Runbook structure - symptoms, investigation steps, remediation, escalation; Writing for 3am clarity - assume tired, stressed reader; Runbook ownership - tying runbooks to services and on-call rotations; Testing runbooks - gameday exercises, chaos engineering; Auto-generated runbooks from monitoring; Runbook vs. troubleshooting guide; When to create a runbook - after second incident of same type; Keeping runbooks current - stale runbooks worse than no runbooks. **Exclude:** Decision logs (Overview 2), General docs (Overviews 1, 4), Governance (Overview 5).

### Overview 4: Building Your Documentation System
**Cover:** Choosing documentation platforms - Confluence, Notion, GitBook, docs-as-code; Docs-as-code approach - Markdown in Git, version control, CI/CD for docs; Information architecture - folder structure, navigation, discoverability; Search as primary navigation; Documentation templates and standards; Screenshot and diagram management; Link rot prevention; Documentation reviews in pull requests; Integration with ITSM and monitoring tools; Cross-linking between docs types. **Exclude:** Philosophy (Overview 1), Specific doc types (Overviews 2-3), Governance (Overview 5).

### Overview 5: Documentation Governance and Culture
**Cover:** Documentation ownership model - who writes, who reviews, who maintains; Doc champions and guilds; Documentation in performance reviews - rewarding good documentation; Scheduled doc sprints and maintenance windows; Measuring doc quality - freshness, usage analytics, user feedback; Archiving outdated docs - keeping searchable but marked obsolete; Documentation onboarding - teaching new hires your doc culture; Balancing completeness with maintainability; Automation opportunities - auto-generating reference docs, flagging stale content; Building a culture of documentation.
