## Audio Overview Prompts

### Overview 1: ML Model Lifecycle and Deprecation Fundamentals

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who manages AI/ML initiatives. They need to understand the ML model lifecycle, why models need to be deprecated, and the stages of model retirement (legacy, deprecated, retired).

**Cover in this overview:**
- The ML model lifecycle: development, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, retirement
- Why models need deprecation: drift, compliance changes, better alternatives, technical debt
- Deprecation stages: Legacy (30+ days, plan migration), Deprecated (90+ days, migrate), Retired (shut down)
- The cost of not deprecating: technical debt, security risks, maintenance burden, confusing users
- Model drift and performance degradation: when models stop working effectively
- Compliance and ethical retirement: GDPR, bias concerns, regulatory requirements
- Planning deprecation from deployment: building sunset into the roadmap
- The difference between deprecating models vs. APIs vs. feature flags

**Exclude from this overview:**
- Specific deprecation communication strategies (covered in Overview 2)
- Model registry and governance tools (covered in Overview 3)
- Feature flag management (covered in Overview 4)
- Complete playbook implementation (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Help the listener understand that deprecation is a planned part of the lifecycle, not a failure. Use examples of model drift and outdated predictions. They should come away understanding why proactive deprecation matters and the stages models go through before retirement.

### Overview 2: Communication and Migration Strategies

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who understands model lifecycle basics. They need to learn how to communicate deprecations to stakeholders, provide migration paths, and manage the timeline from announcement to sunset.

**Cover in this overview:**
- Communication timeline: 3-6 months notice for significant deprecations, longer for critical systems
- Who to communicate with: internal consumers, external API users, business stakeholders
- What to communicate: deprecation reason, timeline, replacement options, migration support
- Deprecation headers for APIs: Deprecation and Sunset HTTP headers for programmatic discovery
- Documentation requirements: keeping deprecated docs live, migration guides, replacement APIs
- Providing drop-in replacements vs. migration effort: minimizing user pain
- Monitoring deprecation usage: tracking who's still using deprecated models/APIs
- Escalation strategies: reaching out to holdouts, understanding blockers
- Managing pushback: when teams resist migration, negotiating timelines
- Graceful vs. hard cutoff: gradual reduction vs. complete shutdown

**Exclude from this overview:**
- Model lifecycle and deprecation stages (already covered in Overview 1)
- Model registry technical details (covered in Overview 3)
- Feature flag cleanup processes (covered in Overview 4)
- Complete playbook creation (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Make communication practical and empathetic. Help the listener understand that deprecation often fails due to poor communication, not technical issues. Use examples of good vs. bad deprecation announcements. They should feel equipped to create a communication plan that gives users time and support to migrate.

### Overview 3: Model Registry and Governance

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who understands deprecation communication. They need to learn how model registries enable governance, track model versions, and manage the model lifecycle from deployment through retirement.

**Cover in this overview:**
- What a model registry is: centralized repository for tracking ML models throughout lifecycle
- Model versioning: semantic versioning (major.minor.patch), tracking changes
- Model metadata: performance metrics, training data, dependencies, deployment history
- Lifecycle stages in registry: development, staging, production, archived, retired
- Role-based access control: who can promote, deprecate, or retire models
- Audit trails: compliance requirements, tracking who deployed what when
- Model lineage: understanding dependencies between models and data
- Integration with MLOps: CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, deployment automation
- Popular registry tools: MLflow, SageMaker Model Registry, Azure ML, Kubeflow
- Using registry for deprecation: marking models as legacy, tracking active deployments, coordinating migration

**Exclude from this overview:**
- Basic model lifecycle concepts (already covered in Overview 1)
- Communication strategies (already covered in Overview 2)
- Feature flag management (covered in Overview 4)
- End-to-end playbook (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Make model registries concrete and valuable. Help the listener understand this isn't just documentation—it's the operational foundation for managing models at scale. Use examples of how registries prevent production incidents and enable safe deprecation. They should understand the business case for implementing a registry.

### Overview 4: Feature Flag Management and Technical Debt

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who understands model deprecation and governance. They need to learn how feature flags accumulate technical debt when not managed properly, and how to establish cleanup processes.

**Cover in this overview:**
- Feature flags for AI/ML: enabling/disabling models, A/B testing, gradual rollout
- Feature flag technical debt: accumulation of old flags, code complexity, maintenance burden
- When to remove flags: 100% or 0% rollout, long-lived flags, completed experiments
- Best practice: write the removal PR when creating the flag
- Naming conventions: human-readable names, indicating purpose and expiration
- Monitoring flag usage: tracking rollout percentage, identifying cleanup candidates
- Setting flag deadlines: hard dates for flag removal, automated reminders
- Limiting flag scope: avoiding flag sprawl, keeping flags focused
- Feature flag management tools: LaunchDarkly, Statsig, Unleash, CloudBees
- The deprecation parallel: flags are mini-APIs that also need sunset plans

**Exclude from this overview:**
- Model lifecycle basics (already covered in Overview 1)
- Deprecation communication (already covered in Overview 2)
- Model registry details (already covered in Overview 3)
- Complete playbook assembly (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Make feature flag debt tangible. Help the listener understand that flags are temporary by nature—keeping them forever defeats the purpose. Use examples of codebases drowning in flags. They should come away with concrete strategies for preventing flag debt and cleaning up existing flags.

### Overview 5: Building a Deprecation Playbook

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who understands deprecation fundamentals, communication, registries, and flag management. Now they need to create a comprehensive deprecation playbook for their organization.

**Cover in this overview:**
- Defining deprecation criteria: when does something qualify for deprecation
- Establishing deprecation timelines: 30/90/180 day standards based on impact
- Creating deprecation checklists: steps from decision through retirement
- Roles and responsibilities: who decides, who communicates, who implements
- Deprecation review cadence: quarterly reviews of deployed models/APIs/features
- Metrics for deprecation health: time to deprecate, active deprecated items, technical debt
- Automated deprecation workflows: alerts for old deployments, automated communication
- Exception processes: when to extend timelines, who approves exceptions
- Documentation templates: deprecation announcements, migration guides, sunset notices
- Learning from deprecations: post-sunset retrospectives, continuous improvement
- Building deprecation culture: making cleanup a valued part of development

**Exclude from this overview:**
- Lifecycle and stages (already covered in Overview 1)
- Communication tactics (already covered in Overview 2)
- Registry implementation (already covered in Overview 3)
- Flag management specifics (already covered in Overview 4)

**Approach:**
Make this actionable and comprehensive. Help the listener create a playbook they can use immediately. Use templates and examples. They should come away with a clear plan for establishing deprecation processes in their organization and building a culture where cleanup is as important as creation.
