## Audio Overview Prompts
### Overview 1: SDI and NDI Fundamentals
SDI (Serial Digital Interface) - dedicated cables, fixed bandwidth, proven reliability; NDI (Network Device Interface) - IP-based, standard network infrastructure.
### Overview 2: Room Design Implications
Cable runs vs network switches, latency requirements, camera placement flexibility, scalability considerations.
### Overview 3: Cost and Infrastructure
SDI infrastructure costs (cables, matrix, converters) vs NDI (network switches, bandwidth), hybrid approaches.
### Overview 4: Use Cases and Decision Criteria
When to use SDI (broadcast quality, guaranteed latency), when to use NDI (flexibility, multi-destination), hybrid workflows.
### Overview 5: Future-Proofing Media Infrastructure
SMPTE ST 2110, IP transition roadmap, maintaining SDI investment while adopting NDI selectively.
