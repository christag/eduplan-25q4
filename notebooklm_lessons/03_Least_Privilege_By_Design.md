## Audio Overview Prompts

### Overview 1: Least Privilege Fundamentals and Zero Trust Principles

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who understands traditional access control but wants to deeply implement least privilege as a core Zero Trust principle. They need to understand why this is foundational, not optional.

**Cover:** The principle of least privilege definition and why it matters; How least privilege fits within Zero Trust ("never trust, always verify"); The attack surface reduction math - reducing privilege duration and scope; Least Privileged User (LPU) concept as the starting point; Time-based privilege analysis (standing vs. temporary access); Common violations and security risks of over-privileged accounts; Real-world breach examples where least privilege would have prevented or limited damage.

**Exclude:** RBAC/GBAC design patterns (Overview 2), JIT implementation details (Overview 3), Cloud IAM specifics (Overview 4), Governance and monitoring (Overview 5).

**Approach:** Help the listener understand this as a mindset shift, not just a technical control. Emphasize the business risk of standing privileges and why "never permanent, always temporary" should be the default for anything beyond read-only access.

### Overview 2: Role-Based and Group-Based Access Control Design

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who understands least privilege principles (from Overview 1) and needs to design RBAC/GBAC systems that scale across their organization.

**Cover:** RBAC fundamentals - roles, permissions, users; Five common RBAC patterns (IDP-based, permissions-based, group-based, hierarchical, hybrid); Group-based models (LDAP/AD style) - organizational units, nested groups; Permission assignment strategies - direct vs. inherited; Role explosion problem and how to avoid it; RBAC vs. ABAC (attribute-based) vs. ReBAC (relationship-based); Designing roles that mirror org structure; Role lifecycle management - creation, modification, deprecation; Microsoft Entra RBAC as a reference implementation.

**Exclude:** Least privilege concepts (Overview 1), JIT mechanics (Overview 3), Cloud platform IAM (Overview 4), Ongoing governance (Overview 5).

**Approach:** This is about architecture and design. Help the listener create scalable, maintainable access control systems that don't become management nightmares. Address common anti-patterns and design smells.

### Overview 3: Just-in-Time Access and Privileged Access Management

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who understands least privilege and RBAC (from Overviews 1-2) and needs to implement Just-in-Time access to eliminate standing privileges.

**Cover:** JIT PAM definition - ephemeral privileges on-demand; The privilege duration problem (168 hours vs. 2 hours); Ephemeral accounts vs. temporary elevation - when to use each; Request/approval workflows for JIT access; Time-based automatic revocation; Break-glass scenarios and emergency access; Integration with RBAC - JIT as an enforcement layer; Session recording and audit trails for temporary privilege use; Reducing credential theft impact through JIT; Real-world JIT implementation at scale.

**Exclude:** Zero Trust fundamentals (Overview 1), RBAC design (Overview 2), Cloud platform specifics (Overview 4), Long-term governance (Overview 5).

**Approach:** Make JIT practical and implementable. Help the listener understand the spectrum from "request a role for 4 hours" to "fully ephemeral accounts that self-destruct." Address concerns about operational overhead and emergency scenarios.

### Overview 4: Cloud IAM Implementation (AWS, Azure, GCP)

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who understands least privilege, RBAC, and JIT concepts (from Overviews 1-3) and needs to implement these principles across multi-cloud environments.

**Cover:** Cloud IAM fundamentals - identity federation, service accounts, role assumption; AWS IAM - policies, roles, resource-based permissions, fine-grained JSON policies; Azure RBAC + Azure AD - conditional access, Privileged Identity Management (PIM), JIT built-in; GCP IAM - service accounts, IAM conditions, Policy Intelligence recommendations; Cross-platform patterns and differences; Service account hygiene - one per function/service, minimal permissions; Cloud-native privilege escalation risks; CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) tools for visibility; Policy-as-code for IAM (Terraform, Pulumi); Multi-cloud centralization strategies.

**Exclude:** Core least privilege concepts (Overview 1), Generic RBAC design (Overview 2), General JIT theory (Overview 3), Ongoing governance processes (Overview 5).

**Approach:** This is cloud-specific implementation guidance. Help the listener understand the unique challenges and opportunities in cloud IAM - especially the service-to-service access patterns that don't exist in traditional environments.

### Overview 5: Governance, Validation, and Continuous Improvement

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who understands least privilege principles and implementation (from Overviews 1-4) and needs to maintain and improve their access control posture over time.

**Cover:** Access certification campaigns - periodic reviews of role membership; Permission right-sizing - identifying unused permissions, reducing scope; Access analytics - who has access to what, dormant accounts, privilege creep detection; Monitoring and alerting - unusual access patterns, privilege escalation attempts; Role lifecycle governance - creation approval, regular review, deprecation triggers; Compliance mapping - SOX, PCI DSS, HIPAA least privilege requirements; Audit trails and forensics for access investigations; Automation opportunities - policy enforcement, automatic revocation, anomaly detection; Maturity progression - from manual to automated least privilege; Measuring success - metrics for least privilege effectiveness.

**Exclude:** Foundational concepts (Overview 1), RBAC design (Overview 2), JIT implementation (Overview 3), Cloud platform setup (Overview 4).

**Approach:** Help the listener build sustainable least privilege programs that don't decay over time. Emphasize that implementation is the beginning, not the end. Focus on practical governance rituals and metrics that demonstrate improvement.

## Usage Instructions

1. Create a new notebook in Google NotebookLM
2. Select and copy all URLs from the "Sources" section above
3. Paste the URLs directly into NotebookLM's source input
4. For each audio overview, copy and paste the corresponding prompt
5. Listen to overviews in sequence (1→2→3→4→5)

This learning path takes you from foundational least privilege principles through practical implementation and sustainable governance.
