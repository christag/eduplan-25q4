### Overview 1: EDR and XDR Telemetry Fundamentals

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew (a mid-size media company) who is leveling up to higher-level tech leadership. They have deployed endpoint security tools (antivirus, possibly basic EDR) but want to understand what high-quality endpoint telemetry looks like and how modern EDR/XDR solutions provide deeper visibility into endpoint behavior.

**Cover in this overview:**
- What endpoint telemetry is: the data collected from endpoints (laptops, servers, mobile devices)
- EDR fundamentals: continuous monitoring, behavioral analytics, threat detection
- XDR evolution: extending detection beyond endpoints to email, network, cloud
- Types of telemetry data collected: process activity, file modifications, network connections, registry changes, user actions
- How telemetry enables threat detection: baselines, anomaly detection, behavioral analysis
- The difference between signature-based detection and telemetry-driven behavioral detection
- Why telemetry quality matters: detection effectiveness, false positive rates, incident response capability
- Modern telemetry architecture: collection, transport, storage, analysis layers

**Exclude from this overview:**
- Coverage gap analysis and agent health monitoring (covered in Overview 2)
- Specific security metrics and KPIs (covered in Overview 3)
- MITRE ATT&CK framework and detection coverage (covered in Overview 4)
- Building a telemetry quality program (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Make telemetry concepts concrete and accessible. Help the listener understand the foundation: what data is collected, why it matters, and how it enables modern threat detection. Use examples of what good telemetry reveals vs. what traditional antivirus misses. The listener should come away understanding why endpoint telemetry is critical for security operations and be able to discuss telemetry capabilities with vendors and peers.

### Overview 2: Coverage Gap Analysis and Agent Health Monitoring

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who now understands EDR/XDR telemetry fundamentals (from Overview 1). They need to learn how to identify and address coverage gaps, monitor agent health, and ensure comprehensive endpoint visibility across their organization.

**Cover in this overview:**
- The coverage gap problem: industry data showing 2% weekly agent failures and 42% partial endpoint protection
- Common coverage gap causes: broken agents (28%), missing agents (12%), outdated agents, disabled agents
- Why coverage gaps are dangerous: blind spots, compliance failures, incident response limitations
- Agent health monitoring: deployment status, update status, communication health, resource usage
- Tools and platforms for gap detection: asset inventory systems, agent coverage dashboards
- How to detect gaps: automated queries, continuous monitoring, alerting on coverage changes
- Agent lifecycle management: deployment, updates, troubleshooting, retirement
- Challenges with multiple security agents: complexity, visibility fragmentation, correlation difficulties
- Remediation strategies: automated deployment, scheduled health checks, enforcement workflows

**Exclude from this overview:**
- EDR/XDR telemetry fundamentals (already covered in Overview 1)
- Security metrics and effectiveness measurement (covered in Overview 3)
- MITRE ATT&CK detection coverage assessment (covered in Overview 4)
- Building comprehensive telemetry quality programs (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Make this practical and actionable. The listener should understand the real-world scope of coverage gaps (using specific industry statistics) and feel equipped to assess their own environment. Emphasize the operational challenge of maintaining agent health across a fleet of endpoints. Use concrete examples of how gaps are discovered and remediated. The listener should come away with specific strategies they can implement immediately.

### Overview 3: Endpoint Security Metrics and Measuring Effectiveness

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who understands endpoint telemetry and coverage gaps (from Overviews 1-2). Now they need to learn what metrics matter for endpoint security, how to measure the effectiveness of their endpoint security program, and how to track improvements over time.

**Cover in this overview:**
- Key endpoint security metrics: detected threats, incident response time, false positive rates, patch compliance, agent coverage percentage
- Metrics that track detections and vulnerabilities over time for program improvement
- Effectiveness indicators: mean time to detect (MTTD), mean time to respond (MTTR), containment success rate
- Telemetry quality metrics: collection completeness, data latency, alert confidence scores
- Alert reduction and quality: moving from hundreds of SIEM alerts to high-confidence detections
- Compliance and posture metrics: policy compliance, configuration compliance, vulnerability exposure
- Operational metrics: agent health percentage, update compliance, system performance impact
- Dashboard and reporting structures: what executives need to see vs. what security teams need
- How to baseline current state and track improvement
- Using metrics to justify security investments and demonstrate value

**Exclude from this overview:**
- EDR/XDR telemetry collection fundamentals (already covered in Overview 1)
- Coverage gap detection and agent health details (already covered in Overview 2)
- MITRE ATT&CK framework specifics (covered in Overview 4)
- Building a telemetry quality program from scratch (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Focus on making security metrics meaningful and actionable. Help the listener understand which metrics actually matter vs. vanity metrics. Use concrete examples of how metrics drive security improvements and support business conversations. The listener should feel confident selecting the right metrics to track, creating dashboards that tell the security story, and using data to continuously improve their endpoint security program.

### Overview 4: MITRE ATT&CK Detection Coverage Assessment

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who understands endpoint telemetry, coverage gaps, and security metrics (from Overviews 1-3). Now they need to learn how to use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to assess their endpoint detection capabilities and understand what adversary techniques they can and cannot detect.

**Cover in this overview:**
- What MITRE ATT&CK is: knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world attacks
- The ATT&CK matrix structure: tactics (what adversaries want to achieve) and techniques (how they achieve it)
- How EDR/XDR solutions map detection rules to ATT&CK techniques
- Realistic expectations: research shows commercial EDR coverage ranges from 48-55% of techniques
- Why perfect coverage is unrealistic: many techniques are unrealizable as detection rules
- Using ATT&CK for threat hunting: mapping endpoint telemetry queries to techniques
- Using ATT&CK for gap assessment: identifying which techniques you can't detect
- MITRE ATT&CK evaluations: how to interpret vendor evaluation results
- Important limitations: ATT&CK coverage doesn't guarantee real-world threat coverage
- Practical application: prioritizing detection improvements based on likely threats to your organization
- Mapping existing security controls to ATT&CK techniques

**Exclude from this overview:**
- EDR/XDR telemetry fundamentals (already covered in Overview 1)
- Coverage gap and agent health monitoring (already covered in Overview 2)
- General security metrics and KPIs (already covered in Overview 3)
- Building comprehensive quality programs (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Make MITRE ATT&CK practical and grounded in reality. Help the listener understand how to use the framework without being overwhelmed by it. Emphasize realistic expectations about coverage (48-55% is typical, not failure). Use examples of how to map their existing security controls to ATT&CK techniques. The listener should come away understanding how to use ATT&CK as a tool for assessment and improvement, not as a checkbox compliance exercise.

### Overview 5: Building a Telemetry Quality Program

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who now understands telemetry fundamentals, coverage gaps, security metrics, and ATT&CK detection coverage (from Overviews 1-4).
