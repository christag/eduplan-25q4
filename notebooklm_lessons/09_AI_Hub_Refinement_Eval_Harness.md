## Audio Overview Prompts

### Overview 1: AI Hub Strategy and Model Selection

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who has deployed various AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) somewhat organically and needs to develop a strategic "AI hub" approach - centralized governance, model selection, and usage guidance.

**Cover:** The organic AI adoption problem - shadow AI, inconsistent usage, no governance; AI hub concept - centralized catalog of approved models and use cases; Model landscape - GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, open vs. closed models; Use case mapping - which models for which tasks (coding, writing, analysis, support); Cost considerations - per-token pricing, enterprise agreements, open-source TCO; Security and compliance - data residency, terms of service, training data concerns; Building an AI acceptable use policy; Procurement strategy - centralized vs. decentralized spending; User guidance - helping employees choose the right tool; Measuring AI ROI and adoption; Integration patterns - API access, chatbot interfaces, embedded features.

**Exclude:** Evaluation methodologies (Overview 2), Technical benchmarking (Overview 3), Custom model evaluation (Overview 4), Long-term optimization (Overview 5).

### Overview 2: LLM Evaluation Fundamentals - The Four Approaches

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who manages an AI hub (from Overview 1) and needs to understand how to evaluate LLM performance beyond marketing claims.

**Cover:** Why evaluation matters - vendor claims vs. reality, use-case specific performance; The four evaluation approaches - human evaluation, benchmark-based, LLM-as-judge, simulation-based; Human evaluation - golden datasets, human raters, inter-rater reliability challenges; Benchmark-based evaluation - standardized tests (MMLU, HumanEval, TruthfulQA), pros and cons; LLM-as-judge - using strong models to evaluate weaker models, limitations and biases; Simulation-based - synthetic datasets, edge case generation; Evaluation dimensions - accuracy, helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty; Task-specific evaluation - coding ability, reasoning, factual recall, creative writing; Limitations of benchmarks - overfitting, not representative of real usage, benchmark saturation; When to use each approach; Combining multiple evaluation methods.

**Exclude:** AI hub strategy (Overview 1), Evaluation harness implementation (Overview 3), Custom evaluations (Overview 4), Operational optimization (Overview 5).

### Overview 3: Implementing Evaluation Harness (EleutherAI LM Eval Harness)

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who understands evaluation approaches (from Overviews 1-2) and needs to implement the EleutherAI Language Model Evaluation Harness for systematic model testing.

**Cover:** What LM Evaluation Harness is - open-source framework, 60+ benchmarks, Hugging Face leaderboard backend; Installation and setup - Python environment, model loading (Transformers, vLLM, API models); Running evaluations - command-line interface, selecting tasks, configuring parameters; Standard benchmarks included - MMLU (knowledge), HumanEval (coding), GSM8K (math), HellaSwag (reasoning); Interpreting results - accuracy scores, confidence intervals, comparison baselines; Evaluating commercial API models - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google; Local model evaluation - quantized models, LoRA adapters; Creating custom tasks for domain-specific evaluation; Automated evaluation pipelines - CI/CD integration, regression testing for model updates; Performance considerations - GPU requirements, evaluation time; Reproducibility and prompt variations.

**Exclude:** Evaluation theory (Overview 2), Custom evaluation design (Overview 4), Program optimization (Overview 5).

### Overview 4: Custom Evaluations for Your Use Cases

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who can run standard benchmarks (from Overviews 1-3) but needs to create custom evaluations that reflect their specific business use cases.

**Cover:** Why custom evaluations matter - public benchmarks don't reflect your use cases; Building golden datasets - curating high-quality examples, representative samples; Domain-specific evaluation - industry terminology, company context, specialized knowledge; Task-based evaluation suites - customer support quality, code generation for your stack, document summarization accuracy; Creating evaluation criteria - defining "good" output for your use cases; Human-in-the-loop evaluation - when to involve subject matter experts; Eval set size - balancing coverage with evaluation cost; Version control for eval datasets - tracking changes, avoiding contamination; Automated evaluation with custom scorers - keyword matching, semantic similarity, structured output validation; Red teaming and adversarial testing - jailbreaks, prompt injection, data leakage; Continuous evaluation - monitoring production AI behavior; Feedback loops - using production data to improve evaluations.

**Exclude:** Strategy (Overview 1), General evaluation theory (Overview 2), Standard harness usage (Overview 3), Long-term operations (Overview 5).

### Overview 5: Operational Excellence - Monitoring, Costs, and Optimization

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who has evaluation systems in place (from Overviews 1-4) and needs to optimize their AI hub operationally - costs, quality, and continuous improvement.

**Cover:** Usage monitoring - tracking adoption by user, department, use case; Cost visibility - per-user, per-model, per-task cost analysis; Cost optimization strategies - model selection (cheaper models for simple tasks), prompt optimization, caching, batch processing; Quality monitoring in production - eval scores over time, user satisfaction, task success rates; Model performance regression detection - alerts when quality drops; A/B testing AI changes - new models, prompt variations, parameter tuning; User feedback integration - thumbs up/down, detailed feedback, issue reporting; ROI measurement - productivity gains, time savings, quality improvements; Scaling considerations - rate limits, quota management, failover strategies; Security posture - prompt injection monitoring, data leakage prevention, access controls; Building AI literacy in your organization - training, best practices, showcasing wins; Future-proofing - staying current with model releases, evaluation methodologies, emerging capabilities.

**Exclude:** Initial strategy (Overview 1), Evaluation fundamentals (Overview 2), Technical implementation (Overviews 3-4).

## Usage Instructions

1. Create a new notebook in Google NotebookLM
2. Copy all URLs from the Sources section and paste into NotebookLM
3. Generate audio overviews using the prompts in sequence (1→2→3→4→5)

This learning path takes you from AI hub strategy through evaluation methodologies, technical implementation, custom evaluation design, and operational optimization.
