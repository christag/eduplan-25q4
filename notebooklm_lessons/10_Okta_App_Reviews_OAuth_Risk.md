## Audio Overview Prompts

### Overview 1: OAuth Fundamentals and the Risk Landscape

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who uses Okta and needs to understand OAuth, why third-party app integrations create risk, and the scope of OAuth-related threats.

**Cover:** OAuth protocol basics - delegated authorization, access without password sharing; OAuth actors - resource owner, client, authorization server, resource server; OAuth flows - authorization code, implicit, client credentials; Why OAuth is everywhere - SaaS integrations, API access, SSO extensions; The security trade-off - convenience vs. control; OAuth consent phishing - attackers create malicious apps that request excessive permissions; OAuth app sprawl - users granting access without IT oversight; Overprivileged OAuth apps - requesting more permissions than needed; Long-lived OAuth tokens - persistent access even after employee leaves; Real-world OAuth attacks - nation-state actors, ransomware, data exfiltration; The SolarWinds OAuth-based compromise example; Why traditional security controls miss OAuth threats.

**Exclude:** Okta-specific configuration (Overview 2), Review program design (Overview 3), Detection and response (Overview 4), Governance and automation (Overview 5).

### Overview 2: Discovering OAuth Apps and API Integrations in Okta

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who understands OAuth risks (from Overview 1) and needs to discover all OAuth apps and API integrations connected to their Okta tenant.

**Cover:** Okta OAuth apps vs. API tokens - what's the difference, why both matter; Finding OAuth apps in Okta admin console - Application list, OAuth scopes review; Identifying third-party integrations - apps users added, IT-sanctioned apps, shadow IT; API token discovery - service account tokens, integration tokens, bot accounts; Understanding OAuth scopes and permissions in Okta context - what scopes allow access to what data; Over-privileged vs. appropriately scoped apps; Inactive integrations - apps granted access but no longer used; User-consented apps - what users can add without admin approval; Using CASB tools for discovery - Valence, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, Netskope; Cloud security posture management (CSPM) for Okta; Export and inventory - creating the master list of all integrations; Categorizing by risk - high/medium/low based on permissions and vendor reputation.

**Exclude:** Risk assessment methodology (Overviews 3-4), Ongoing governance (Overview 5).

### Overview 3: Designing an OAuth App Review Program

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who has inventoried OAuth apps (from Overviews 1-2) and needs to build a systematic review program to assess and manage OAuth risk.

**Cover:** Review program goals - reduce over-privileged apps, remove unused apps, block malicious apps; Risk assessment framework - evaluating app trustworthiness, vendor reputation, permission scope, usage patterns; Third-party risk management (TPRM) integration - OAuth apps as vendors, security questionnaires; Request and approval workflow - users request OAuth apps, IT/security reviews before approval; Review frequency - quarterly for high-risk, annually for low-risk, continuous for anomalies; Ownership assignment - every OAuth app needs an owner/sponsor; Review criteria - business justification, security posture, data access, alternatives; Stakeholder engagement - working with business units, explaining risk without blocking work; Communication strategy - how to explain OAuth risk to non-technical users; Remediation workflows - revoking access, reducing scope, replacing with safer alternatives; Balancing security with productivity - not becoming the "department of no"; Building the business case - demonstrating risk reduction, compliance alignment.

**Exclude:** Discovery methods (Overview 2), Technical detection (Overview 4), Automation (Overview 5).

### Overview 4: Detection, Monitoring, and Incident Response

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who has a review program (from Overviews 1-3) and needs to detect OAuth attacks, monitor for anomalies, and respond to incidents.

**Cover:** OAuth consent phishing detection - newly created apps, suspicious permission requests, typosquatting; Behavioral anomalies - unusual data access patterns, after-hours usage, geographic anomalies; Okta behavior detection - built-in risk scoring, Velocity monitoring, impossible travel; SIEM integration - logging OAuth events, correlation with other security signals; Alerting on high-risk OAuth activity - new app grants, scope changes, token usage spikes; Indicators of compromise specific to OAuth - token exfiltration, API abuse, lateral movement via OAuth; Incident response playbook for OAuth attacks - contain, investigate, remediate, communicate; Forensic investigation - OAuth audit logs, token usage analysis, blast radius assessment; Revoking compromised OAuth tokens - immediate access termination; User notification and re-education after phishing; Post-incident review - how did attacker succeed, what controls failed; Threat intelligence for OAuth - known malicious apps, campaign patterns.

**Exclude:** Program design (Overview 3), Long-term governance (Overview 5).

### Overview 5: Governance, Automation, and Continuous Improvement

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who can detect and respond to OAuth threats (from Overviews 1-4) and needs to mature their OAuth governance program with automation and continuous improvement.

**Cover:** Policy-as-code for OAuth - defining acceptable permissions, auto-blocking high-risk patterns; Automated discovery and classification - continuous scanning for new OAuth apps; Risk scoring automation - ML-based risk assessment, anomaly detection; Auto-remediation for policy violations - revoking over-privileged apps, notifying owners; Integration with identity governance (IGA) - OAuth apps in access certification campaigns; Privileged access management for OAuth - treating OAuth tokens like privileged credentials; Secrets scanning in code repositories - finding hardcoded OAuth tokens; Developer education - secure OAuth implementation practices, scope minimization; App catalog and self-service - pre-approved integrations users can add safely; Metrics and reporting - OAuth risk posture over time, review completion rates, time to remediate; Compliance mapping - OAuth controls for SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR; Benchmarking and maturity assessment - where are you vs. peers; Future considerations - FAPI (Financial-grade API), OAuth 2.1, emerging standards.

**Exclude:** Fundamentals (Overview 1), Discovery (Overview 2), Initial program design (Overview 3), Incident response (Overview 4).

## Usage Instructions

1. Create a new notebook in Google NotebookLM
2. Copy all URLs from the Sources section and paste into NotebookLM
3. Generate audio overviews using the prompts in sequence (1→2→3→4→5)

This learning path takes you from OAuth fundamentals through discovery, program design, detection/response, and mature governance.
