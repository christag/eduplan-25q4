## Audio Overview Prompts

### Overview 1: Microsegmentation Fundamentals and Why It Matters

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who has traditional VLAN-based network segmentation and needs to understand what microsegmentation is, how it differs from traditional approaches, and why it's a Zero Trust imperative.

**Cover:** Traditional segmentation (VLANs, subnets) vs. microsegmentation (workload-level); The lateral movement problem - how attackers traverse flat networks; Microsegmentation enables secure zones that isolate critical assets; How microsegmentation works - policy-based controls at the workload/application level; The shift from network-centric to identity-centric security; Benefits - reduced blast radius, improved compliance, better visibility; CISA guidance on microsegmentation as Zero Trust pillar; Why microsegmentation is hard - visibility challenges, policy complexity, operational impact; When to use microsegmentation vs. traditional segmentation; Real-world breach examples where microsegmentation would have limited damage.

**Exclude:** Implementation planning (Overview 2), ACL and role design (Overview 3), Technology platforms (Overview 4), Rollout and operations (Overview 5).

### Overview 2: Planning Your Microsegmentation Journey - The CISA Phased Approach

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who understands microsegmentation concepts (from Overview 1) and needs a pragmatic, phased approach to planning implementation based on CISA guidance.

**Cover:** CISA's phased approach - start small, expand over time; Phase 1 - Gain visibility (network flows, application dependencies, communication patterns); Phase 2 - Define security zones (crown jewels, high-value assets, DMZ, internal, external); Phase 3 - Map dependencies (what talks to what, why, how often); Phase 4 - Define policies (allow/deny rules based on least privilege); Starting with highest-risk assets - payment systems, customer data, admin infrastructure; The importance of baselining normal traffic before enforcement; Testing in monitor-only mode; Quick wins for momentum - isolating known-bad traffic, segmenting contractors/guests; Building the business case - risk reduction, compliance alignment, operational benefits.

**Exclude:** Core concepts (Overview 1), Technical implementation (Overviews 3-4), Day-to-day operations (Overview 5).

### Overview 3: Role-Based Segmentation and ACL Hygiene

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who is planning microsegmentation (from Overviews 1-2) and needs to design role-based segmentation policies and clean up existing ACL sprawl.

**Cover:** Role-based micro segmentation - defining roles (web tier, app tier, database tier, admin workstations); Identity-driven policies vs. IP-based policies; ACL hygiene fundamentals - documenting existing rules, removing unused rules, consolidating overlapping rules; The ACL sprawl problem - years of "temporary" rules that became permanent; Discovering what ACLs actually do vs. what they're supposed to do; Application dependency mapping for accurate policies; Least privilege principles in microsegmentation policies; Time-based access rules for maintenance windows; Exception handling without creating policy holes; Documentation requirements - every rule needs a business justification; Change control for microsegmentation policies.

**Exclude:** Fundamentals (Overview 1), High-level planning (Overview 2), Platform selection (Overview 4), Operations (Overview 5).

### Overview 4: Technology Platforms and Implementation Approaches

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who has designed microsegmentation policies (from Overviews 1-3) and needs to select and implement microsegmentation technology.

**Cover:** Microsegmentation technology categories - network-based (firewall rules), host-based (agent on endpoints), virtualization-based (hypervisor level); Vendor landscape - Illumio, ColorTokens, Akamai Guardicore, Cisco, Palo Alto, VMware NSX; Cloud-native microsegmentation - AWS security groups, Azure NSGs, GCP firewall rules; Kubernetes network policies for container microsegmentation; Choosing the right approach for your environment - on-prem vs. cloud vs. hybrid; Agent vs. agentless considerations; Integration with existing firewalls and SIEM; Policy orchestration and automation; Visibility and monitoring capabilities; Performance impact considerations; Cost models - licensing, implementation, ongoing operations.

**Exclude:** Core concepts (Overview 1), Planning (Overview 2), Policy design (Overview 3), Day-to-day operations (Overview 5).

### Overview 5: Rollout, Operations, and Continuous Improvement

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director who has selected microsegmentation technology (from Overviews 1-4) and needs to roll it out operationally and sustain the program.

**Cover:** Pilot selection - choosing low-risk, high-value initial segments; Monitor-only deployment - observing before enforcing; Communicating with application owners and stakeholders; Handling policy violations - investigation workflows, legitimate exceptions vs. attacks; Emergency break-glass procedures when policies block critical services; Change management for microsegmentation policies - approval processes, testing, rollback; Measuring success - blocked lateral movement attempts, reduced attack surface, compliance improvements; Expanding segmentation coverage - which zones to tackle next; Automation opportunities - policy generation from observed traffic, automatic rule cleanup; Integration with incident response - using segmentation for containment; Maintaining policies over time - adapting to application changes, decommissioning old rules; Building microsegmentation expertise in your team.

**Exclude:** Fundamentals (Overview 1), Initial planning (Overview 2), Policy design (Overview 3), Technology selection (Overview 4).
