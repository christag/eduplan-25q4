## Audio Overview Prompts

### Overview 1: Unicast vs Multicast Fundamentals

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew (a mid-size media company with broadcast and video production operations) who is leveling up to higher-level tech leadership. They understand basic networking but need to understand the fundamental differences between unicast and multicast for IP video distribution, including when each approach makes sense.

**Cover in this overview:**
- What unicast is: one-to-one communication, separate streams per recipient
- What multicast is: one-to-many communication, single stream to multiple recipients
- How unicast works: TCP/UDP sessions, individual connections, per-recipient bandwidth
- How multicast works: UDP multicast groups, network replication, shared bandwidth
- Bandwidth comparison: concrete example using 6 Mbps HD stream to 100 viewers (unicast = 600 Mbps, multicast = 6 Mbps)
- The fundamental efficiency difference: unicast sender load scales with viewers, multicast sender load is constant
- When to use unicast: OTT streaming, personalized content, on-demand video, internet delivery
- When to use multicast: IPTV, corporate video, live events on private networks, large audiences
- Why multicast doesn't work over the public internet: requires multicast-enabled routers, ISP support
- The tradeoff: multicast bandwidth efficiency vs. unicast flexibility and personalization

**Exclude from this overview:**
- IGMP and multicast group management protocols (covered in Overview 2)
- PIM multicast routing details (covered in Overview 3)
- SMPTE 2110 broadcast standards (covered in Overview 4)
- Enterprise multicast network design and implementation (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Make the fundamental difference crystal clear using concrete bandwidth examples. Help the listener understand that multicast is not "better"—it's different, with specific use cases. Use analogies (multicast is like a radio broadcast, unicast is like phone calls). The listener should come away understanding when each technology fits and be able to explain the tradeoffs to leadership and vendors.

### Overview 2: IGMP and Multicast Group Management

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who now understands unicast vs. multicast fundamentals (from Overview 1). They need to learn how multicast actually works at the protocol level, particularly IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) and how devices join/leave multicast groups.

**Cover in this overview:**
- What IGMP is: the protocol that manages multicast group membership on IPv4 networks
- How receivers join multicast groups: IGMP membership reports, signaling interest to routers
- Multicast group addresses: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 range, group addressing
- How IGMP queries work: routers periodically querying which groups have active members
- IGMP snooping on switches: preventing multicast flooding, forwarding only to interested ports
- The join/leave process: how receivers signal interest and unsubscribe from groups
- IGMP versions: IGMPv1, v2, v3 differences and improvements
- Why IGMP matters for video: efficient delivery, avoiding unnecessary network traffic
- IGMP configuration requirements: router and switch settings for multicast support
- Troubleshooting multicast: common IGMP misconfigurations, testing group membership

**Exclude from this overview:**
- Unicast vs. multicast fundamentals (already covered in Overview 1)
- PIM multicast routing between subnets (covered in Overview 3)
- SMPTE 2110 broadcast applications (covered in Overview 4)
- Enterprise network design and deployment (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Make IGMP understandable without overwhelming protocol details. Help the listener understand that IGMP is the "membership management" layer—how endpoints signal interest in multicast streams. Use diagrams (described verbally) showing how join/leave messages flow. The listener should understand why switches and routers need IGMP configuration and be able to troubleshoot basic multicast group membership issues.

### Overview 3: PIM Multicast Routing

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who understands multicast fundamentals and IGMP (from Overviews 1-2). Now they need to learn how multicast routing works across subnets and WANs using PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast), including the different PIM modes and when each applies.

**Cover in this overview:**
- What PIM is: Protocol Independent Multicast, routing multicast traffic between subnets
- Why "protocol independent": PIM leverages existing unicast routing (OSPF, EIGRP, BGP) for topology
- How PIM works: uses unicast routing table for reverse-path forwarding, builds distribution trees
- PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): explicit join model, uses rendezvous points (RP), best for enterprise
- PIM Dense Mode (PIM-DM): flood-and-prune model, assumes most routers want traffic
- Rendezvous Point (RP): the meeting point in PIM-SM where sources and receivers connect
- Source-specific multicast trees vs. shared trees: efficiency vs. scalability tradeoffs
- PIM-SM operation: receivers join via RP, optionally switch to source-specific shortest-path trees
- When to use PIM-SM: enterprise video, IPTV, most production multicast deployments
- When to use PIM-DM: small networks, dense receiver distribution, specific use cases
- PIM configuration: designating RPs, enabling PIM on interfaces, multicast routing tables

**Exclude from this overview:**
- Unicast vs. multicast basics (already covered in Overview 1)
- IGMP group management within subnets (already covered in Overview 2)
- SMPTE 2110 broadcast standards (covered in Overview 4)
- Complete network design and implementation (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Make multicast routing accessible. Help the listener understand that PIM is the "between-subnet" layer while IGMP is the "within-subnet" layer. Focus on PIM-SM since it's most common in enterprise. Use examples of how RPs work and why shared trees make sense. The listener should understand the basic architecture of multicast routing and be able to discuss PIM requirements with network engineers.

### Overview 4: SMPTE 2110 and Multicast for Professional Broadcast

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who understands multicast fundamentals, IGMP, and PIM routing (from Overviews 1-3). Now they need to learn how modern IP broadcast uses multicast in SMPTE ST 2110 systems, replacing traditional SDI with IP-based professional media workflows.

**Cover in this overview:**
- What SMPTE ST 2110 is: professional media over IP standard, replacing SDI in broadcast facilities
- How ST 2110 uses multicast: separate video, audio, and data essence streams over IP multicast
- Why multicast for broadcast: one-to-many distribution, replacing SDI routers with Ethernet switches
- The SDI-to-IP transition: benefits of IP multicast (flexibility, scalability, remote production)
- Bandwidth requirements: 10+ Gbps networks, uncompressed video over IP
- IGMP requirements for ST 2110: multicast group management in broadcast environments
- Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): managing RTP streams, multicast distribution signaling
- Red/Blue network architecture: dual multicast paths for redundancy (from DR lesson)
- Limitations: ST 2110 multicast works on LANs, not over internet, requires specialized networking
- Distributed production: remote production workflows enabled by IP multicast
- The broadcast-specific challenge: maintaining timing, synchronization (PTP) across multicast streams

**Exclude from this overview:**
- Basic unicast vs. multicast concepts (already covered in Overview 1)
- IGMP fundamentals (already covered in Overview 2)
- PIM routing basics (already covered in Overview 3)
- General enterprise multicast deployment (covered in Overview 5)

**Approach:**
Connect multicast fundamentals to real-world broadcast applications. Help the listener understand how multicast enables the SDI-to-IP transition in broadcast facilities. Use the Morning Brew context—they have broadcast operations, so ST 2110 is relevant. The listener should understand why broadcast adopted multicast, what makes it different from enterprise multicast (uncompressed, timing-critical), and how it fits into their infrastructure roadmap.

### Overview 5: Enterprise Multicast Network Design and Implementation

You are creating an audio overview for a senior IT director at Morning Brew who now understands multicast fundamentals, protocols (IGMP, PIM), and broadcast applications (Overviews 1-4). Now they need to learn how to actually design and deploy multicast for enterprise video distribution, including planning, configuration, testing, and common pitfalls.

**Cover in this overview:**
- Enterprise multicast use cases: corporate video, all-hands meetings, training, IPTV, digital signage
- Network readiness assessment: does existing infrastructure support multicast, bandwidth availability
- Planning multicast deployment: identifying sources, receiver locations, group addressing scheme
- Router configuration: enabling PIM, configuring rendezvous points (RPs), multicast routing
- Switch configuration: IGMP snooping, preventing multicast flooding, port-based forwarding
- Multicast addressing strategy: group address allocation, avoiding conflicts
- Bandwidth planning: calculating aggregate multicast bandwidth, trunk capacity, QoS considerations
- Testing multicast: validating group membership, testing stream delivery, troubleshooting tools
- Common pitfalls: IGMP snooping misconfigurations, missing PIM configuration, bandwidth bottlenecks
- Multicast vs. eCDN (enterprise CDN): when to use multicast, when to use unicast overlay networks
- Scalability considerations: multicast scales infinitely for viewers, but router state can be a limit
- Integration with existing infrastructure: multicast in hybrid environments, gradual rollout

**Exclude from this overview:**
- Unicast vs. multicast fundamentals (already covered in Overview 1)
- IGMP and PIM protocol details (already covered in Overviews 2-3)
- SMPTE 2110 broadcast specifics (already covered in Overview 4)

**Approach:**
Make this practical and implementation-focused. The listener should come away with a clear roadmap for evaluating and deploying multicast in their environment. Emphasize that multicast requires planning and network support—it's not plug-and-play like unicast. Use examples of successful enterprise deployments. The listener should feel equipped to scope a multicast project, work with network engineers on configuration, and avoid common mistakes.
